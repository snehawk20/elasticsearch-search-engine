Local comic creators launch their new publications and showcase their work at these events.[13]\n\nThe 2014 Reader's Den Free Comic Book Day event saw the launch of 15 new South African comic books, with some creators traveling from different parts of South Africa for the event.[5] The Reader's Den Free Comic Book Day event was replaced in 2016 with FanCon Cape Town Comic Con, an international comics convention that is held annually in April.\n\nThe Open Book Comics Fest forms part of the annual Open Book Festival, which takes place every September in Cape Town. The Open Book Comics Fest promotes South African comic artists, illustrators and cartoonists and includes a marketplace of over 40 tables, curated by Moray Rhoda.[14]\n\nComic Con Africa debuted in Johannesburg in September 2018.[15][16]\n\nThese comic book related events host market places where local comic creators sell and sign their self-published comics, launch new comics and deliver comic-industry-related talks, panels, and workshops.\n\n"

Highbone Theater and Dungeon Quest are published in the USA by Fantagraphics Books. In Europe, Dungeon Quest is published by L'Association. It was nominated for the Ignatz and Eisner awards and won the coveted Angoulême Jury Prize.[19] His work has been described as \"surreal, scatological, yet grounded in its depiction of loneliness and longing.\"[20] Slings & Arrows praised it as \"an irreverent satire of geek culture.\"[21]\n\nOther South African comic creators with international publications include Karl Stephan,[22] the author of Sparko, published by SLG; Sean Izaakse,[23] an artist on Pathfinder for Dynamite Entertainment and various Marvel Comics titles; Jason Masters,[24] who has worked for DC Comics on various titles, including Batman, and for Dynamite Entertainment on James Bond; and  Lauren Beukes and Dale Halvorsen, who co-wrote Survivors' Club for DC/Vertigo.[19] Artist Warren Louw[25] illustrates variant covers for KRS Comics.\n\nLJ Phillips[26] has contributed work to Borderx,[27] Future Sci-Fi Tales, Horror Haikus, The Red Ten, Iron Nail Afternoon[28] and Dark Encounters among others. Her work has been published under her own name and a male pseudonym. Some of her articles on comics were published by Black Ship Books and included in Into the Comics-Verse: Comics and Contemporary Culture.[29] She has interviewed international comic creators  such as Terry Moore, Stjepan Sejic,[30] Liam Sharp and Tracy Butler.[31] In August 2020, LJ was the recipient of a comic grant by Eisner-nominated publisher Shortbox.[32] and in 2022, was included in the Otherwise honours list.[33]\n\n"
