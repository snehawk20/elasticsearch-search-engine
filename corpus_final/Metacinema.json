            "text": "\nMetacinema, also meta-cinema, is a mode of filmmaking in which the film informs the audience that they are watching a work of fiction. Metacinema often references its own production, working against narrative conventions that aim to maintain the audience's suspension of disbelief.[1] Elements of metacinema includes scenes where characters discuss the making of the film or where production equipment and facilities are shown. It is analogous to metafiction in literature.\n\n"

            "text": "Examples of metacinema date back to the early days of narrative filmmaking.[citation needed] In the 1940s, backstage musicals and comedies like Road to Singapore (Victor Schertzinger, 1940) and Hellzapoppin' (H. C. Potter, 1941) exhibited a vogue for exploration of the medium of film at a time when Hollywood classicism dominated.[2] Metacinema can be identified in art cinema of the 1960s like 8½ (Federico Fellini, 1963) or The Passion of Anna (Ingmar Bergman, 1969), and it can often be found in the self-reflexive filmmaking of the French New Wave in films like Contempt (Jean-Luc Godard, 1963) and Day for Night (François Truffaut, 1973). Other examples include F for Fake (Orson Welles, 1973) and Through the Olive Trees (Abbas Kiarostami, 1994).[3]\n\nCommunity (2009–2015) is a sitcom which has elements of metacinema, particularly through the character of Abed Nadir (Danny Pudi) who makes comments about himself and his friends being in a sitcom, such as commenting that they are in a bottle episode in the bottle episode: Cooperative Calligraphy (Series 2: Episode 8), and the episode Messianic Myths and Ancient Peoples (Series 2: Episode 5) consists of Abed making his own metacinema film.\n\n"
